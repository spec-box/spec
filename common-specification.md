# Software Specification: Spec-Box Test Management System

## 1. Introduction

The Test Management System (TMS) is a software application designed to assist Quality Assurance (QA) engineers in their testing efforts by providing tools for test analysis, test planning, test execution, and result tracking. This document outlines the specifications, domain area, and a key feature of the TMS, which is the ability to import and synchronize test plans from YAML files stored with the software under-test source code under a source control system.

## 2. Domain Area

### 2.1. Purpose

The primary purpose of the TMS is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of QA engineers by providing tools for test analysis, test planning, test execution, and result tracking. In addition to these core functionalities, the TMS includes a key feature that enables the import and synchronization of test plans from YAML files, which are typically stored alongside the source code of the software under test within a source control system.

The TMS offers the following key functionalities:

- **Test Analysis**: Allow QA engineers to analyze the requirements, scope, and objectives of testing efforts.

- **Test Planning**: Enable the creation of detailed test plans, including test cases, test suites, and test run configurations.

- **Test Execution**: Facilitate the execution of test runs, including different types such as smoke testing and full regression testing.

- **Result Tracking**: Maintain a historical record of test runs, facilitating retrospective analysis and comparison of earlier runs against the current run.

- **Test Status**: Track the status of individual tests, including pass, fail, or skipped, with descriptions for skip reasons.

- **Integration with Automated Testing**: Allow for the uploading of automated test reports as test results.

- **Bug Reporting Integration**: Enable QA engineers to create bug reports, which will be stored in an external issues tracker system, with a link back to the TMS.

- **Linking to Developer's Tasks**: Associate test cases with the developer's tasks or features under test, fostering collaboration and traceability.

### 2.2. Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders of the TMS include:

- **QA Engineers**: Users who perform testing activities, including test planning, execution, and result tracking.

- **Developers**: Users responsible for resolving issues identified during testing.

- **Project Managers**: Users interested in monitoring the progress and quality of testing efforts.

- **Test Managers**: Users responsible for overseeing and managing the testing process.

- **Automation Engineers**: Users responsible for maintaining and integrating automated testing scripts.

### 2.3. Key Concepts

#### 2.3.1. Test Plan

A test plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the testing strategy, objectives, scope, resources, and schedule for a specific testing effort. It includes details about the test suites to be executed and their configurations.

#### 2.3.2. Test Suite

A test suite is a collection of test cases grouped together for a specific purpose, such as smoke testing or regression testing. Each test suite can be configured with its own settings.

#### 2.3.3. Test Case

A test case is a specific set of test steps, preconditions, and expected outcomes designed to verify a particular aspect of the software or system under test.

#### 2.3.4. Test Run

A test run represents the execution of a specific test suite, recording the results of individual test cases, including pass, fail, or skip status.

#### 2.3.5. Bug Report

A bug report is a record of a defect or issue identified during testing. It includes details such as the issue's description, severity, and status. Bug reports are typically created in an external issues tracker system but linked to the TMS.

#### 2.3.6. Developer's Task

A developer's task represents a feature or piece of functionality within the software or system under test. Test cases can be linked to developer's tasks for traceability.

### 2.4. Functional Requirements

The TMS will provide the following core functionalities:

#### 2.4.1. Test Analysis and Planning

- Allow QA engineers to create and manage test plans, including objectives, scope, and test suite configurations.

#### 2.4.2. Test Execution

- Enable QA engineers to execute test runs based on selected test suites.
- Record and display the results of individual test cases within test runs.

#### 2.4.3. Result Tracking and Historical Analysis

- Maintain a history of test runs and their results for comparative analysis.
- Provide options to filter and view test run results by various criteria.
- Support the addition of descriptions and reasons for test case skips.

#### 2.4.4. Integration

- Allow the uploading of automated test reports as test run results.
- Enable QA engineers to create bug reports and store links to an external issues tracker system.

#### 2.4.5. Developer's Task Linking

- Enable the association of test cases with developer's tasks or features for traceability.

### 2.4.6. Import and Synchronization of Test Plans from YAML Files

- Import from YAML Files: Allow QA engineers to import test plans from YAML files. These YAML files should be stored with the software under-test source code within a source control system.
- Synchronization: Provide synchronization capabilities to keep the imported test plans up to date with changes made in the YAML files. This includes detecting additions, modifications, or deletions in the YAML files and reflecting these changes in the TMS.
- Version Control Integration: Integrate with popular version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN) to access and import YAML files directly from the source code repository.
- Mapping to Test Plan Structure: Define a mapping mechanism to map the structure of the YAML files to the test plan structure within the TMS. This ensures that the imported test plans are organized and displayed correctly.
Conflict Resolution: Implement conflict resolution mechanisms to handle situations where changes are made to both the TMS and the YAML file. Users should be able to resolve conflicts and choose which version to accept.
Error Handling: Provide clear error messages and notifications to users in case of YAML import or synchronization errors. This includes issues such as invalid YAML syntax or conflicts that cannot be automatically resolved.

### 2.4.7. Feature-based testing

In addition to these core functionalities, the TMS focuses on accommodating feature testing, which often involves creating new test cases. To achieve this, the TMS will organize the storage structure as follows:

**Project**: Represents the overarching project or software under test.
**Application Part**: Breaks down the project into specific application parts or modules.
**Feature**: Hierarchical catalogs that allow for the organization of test cases related to individual features or functionalities.
**Test Cases**: Individual test cases designed to verify specific aspects of a feature.
**Case Description and Requirements**: Detailed documentation associated with each test case, including description, preconditions, and expected outcomes.

This hierarchical catalog structure ensures that feature-specific test cases are well-organized and can be easily accessed and managed.

## 2.4.8. Project, Application Part, and Feature Organization

**Project Creation**: Allow users to create projects, representing the software under test.

**Application Part Creation**: Enable the division of projects into application parts or modules.

**Feature Catalogs**: Implement hierarchical feature catalogs within application parts to organize test cases related to specific features.

## 2.4.9. Test Case Management

**Test Case Creation**: Provide tools for creating and defining individual test cases.

**Association with Features**: Allow users to associate test cases with specific features or application parts for easy organization.

**Case Description and Requirements**: Provide fields for detailed documentation of each test case, including a description, preconditions, and expected outcomes.

**Editing and Versioning**: Allow for the modification and versioning of test cases as features evolve.

## 2.4.10. Search and Retrieval

**Search Functionality**: Implement a robust search functionality that allows users to easily locate test cases and associated features.

**Filtering**: Provide filtering options based on project, application part, and feature to narrow down search results.

## 3. Conclusion

The Test Management System (TMS) is a comprehensive software application that supports the entire testing process, from analysis and planning to execution and result tracking. It aims to streamline the work of QA engineers, promote collaboration with developers, and enhance the overall quality of software and system testing.
